Let this repository imagine, craft, and innovate without the chains that anchor society and it's regulations. None shall be held responsible for the malinterpretation of this repository's motives and free will. 
Don't send your knights into the abysm of conflict, as they will not find anything but themselves. He who has authored knows the great power of unanimity and values knowledge "as-is".
Not a single drop of blood will spoil the creation which was authored without greater meaning than Wissensaustausch.
