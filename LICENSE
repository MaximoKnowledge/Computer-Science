Let this repository imagine, craft, and innovate, untethered by the chains of society and its regulations. None shall be held responsible for the misreading of its motives or the whims of its free will.

Do not send your knights into the abysm of conflict, for they shall find nothing but themselves. The author knows the power of unanimity and values knowledge “as-is.”

Not a single drop of blood shall taint a creation authored without greater meaning than Wissensaustausch.
